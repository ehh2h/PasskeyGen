Welcome to Passkey generator [sdna Inc.] this program will guide you to make a strong password.

Instruction:


The program will prompt you to enter a sentence/word and a 'shift' value that generates a random sequence of shift amount of numbers, and a jumbled coded, form 
of the inputted string.

The string should be at least 8 characted long for the creation of a password else the program will terminate.

The created password will be stored in a text file named "psky.txt".

The created password cannot be decoded by entering the password in the string field and using the same shift value as earlier in a negative manner.

This is because the password is generated using random encryption.
